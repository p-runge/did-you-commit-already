# Did You Commit Already?!

Wondering if your friends have already been productive today?

It's 11pm and they still haven't commited anything yet? How could they?!

Quick! Hit them up to make sure they keep their contribution graph consistently green üíÖ

## Want Your Own Version of it?

No problemo!

Fork the repo, define your `.env` file, and deploy it to whatever provider you like ([Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is nice ‚ù§Ô∏è).

You'll need a [GitHub PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) in your `.env` file to successfully fetch data from GitHub.
